              <p>HubSpot was founded in 2006 as a result of a simple observation: people have transformed how they live, work, shop and buy, but businesses have not adapted. This mismatch led Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah to create the vision for the inbound experience and to develop HubSpot's platform to support it. With our powerful, easy to use, integrated set of applications, businesses can attract, engage and delight customers by delivering inbound experiences that are relevant, helpful and personalized.</p>
